# cvgui

Python classes for easily building GUI tools to manipulate computer vision data, and an application for visualizing trajectory data extracted from [TrafficIntelligence](https://bitbucket.org/Nicolas/trafficintelligence/wiki/Home). These classes provide an quick means for building GUI applications with undo-able actions, as demonstrated by the cvTrajOverlay player. NOTE: The cvTrajOverlay player requires the MTO's cvtools package for loading and manipulating trajectory data (URL coming soon...)
